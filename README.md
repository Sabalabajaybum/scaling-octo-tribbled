# keylogger-chrome-extension
This is a chrome extension, which implements a white hat hacking-keylogger. The logger detects whenever a password is entered on a chrome webpage. It then records the key logs and sends the password along with other relevant form data on email. The email-id to which the details are sent can be changed using the extension options.
